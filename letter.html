            Suropriya, <br>
            I'm so sorry. I did not wanted to make you cry. I just tried to make you smile. Suddenly I realized
            that i'm felling in love with you. But i know that you always thought me as your friend. Not more than that.
            But somehow I loved you. I never thought that i'll find myself completely and utterly consumed by any
            other. Until I met to my Elizabeth Bennet(Suropriya). I never thought that I will write poem for any other
            girl. But I did. For you. When I realized that i'm being weak for you, I tried to take off myself from your life.
            But it hurts me soo bad. I thought I will never tell you that I love you. But I can't stay without saying
            that. Now i'm letting you know that I love you. The descition is yours. What you'll do after knowing that.
            If you don't love me, I don't have any complain against you. Because it's my fault. If I don't love you, we
            can carry up our friendship. But loving you, don't letting me continue our friendship. So there just two option
            left. Love me or leave me. Let me know what you gonna do. But my last sentence is that, "I Love
            You."<br><br> It's,<br>Your Hating Ones <br>Md. Siam Mia.
